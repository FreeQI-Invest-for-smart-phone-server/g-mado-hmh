256 BIT AES Encryptions.
Protection to modifie.

You create and install the digital certificate of your iPhone.

This certificate encrypts all transmissions made between the operator's APN and your iPhone as long as you only use the line under (WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger).

The internet is a Tiramisu on which we are just adding layers.

Encryption of your bank information read on a website.
It is the https: // protocol with an SSL certificate.

When we transfer personal data, it is often encrypted. These are the international standards that secure our information.

The big question that concerns us:
Who is able to decode this layer of SSL or SSH encryption through which our sensitive data travels?

Technically nobody!

So add a layer of RSA 2048 encryption to your tiramisu.
It won't hurt it, and you will have a secure tunnel through which all your internet data passes from the operator's APN to your smartphone.

You create a unique digital certificate for transmissions encrypted by a certification authority (SSL).

- Chrome, Safari, Firefox
- Apple i-Messages.
- Digital conversations.
- Messenger
- WhatsApp
- Your Gmail mailbox
- All dialogs between applications and internet.

The APN is like your ADSL line.

You use a third party to encrypt all of your digital transmissions, it is the PROFILE that I suggest you install below.

Not included direct dialogues with the SIM card.

Only works for iPhones with a Swiss mobile operator, the link is to be opened exclusively from Safari for the operator you use.

If your device becomes unusually hot.
This is the backup that does its background work in the device.
Obviously, the certificate encrypts all Internet data. The iCloud backup goes through the internet to the iCloud server on Mac which also encrypts it.
For your security it copies all the data encrypted by the certificate :) That's why her ass is getting a little hot.
Otherwise it is a formidable tool, additional protection. Il can add other operators, for encryption, other countries. I would be honored to add them to you.  
ask me, I would.             

A VPN makes you insecure, you don't know who you are connected to or what server. While an APN certificate is better because you are the security! (a certificate is guaranteed by an SSL certification authority which is an insurance).                               
            
On the new iphone 8s if the safari browser is blocked, Google blocks it!
Take an iphone 6 install the APN certificate then make a backup with ithune.
Take your iphone 8s 64 and restore the iphone 6 backup, restart safari and you will have the APN certificate installed in your iphone 8s under General/VPN...
